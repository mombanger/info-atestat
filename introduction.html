            <h2>What Are Semiconductors?</h2>
            <p>Semiconductors are the foundation of modern technology. They are materials that can act as both conductors and insulators, depending on conditions, making them essential for electronic devices like computers, smartphones, and even clocks.</p>
            <p>Think of semiconductors as the tiny switches that control the flow of electricity in a circuit. Modern devices contain millions of these interconnected switches, enabling them to process complex tasks at lightning speed.</p>
