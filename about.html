            <h2>What Are Semiconductors?</h2>
            <p>At their core, semiconductors are materials that sit between conductors (like copper) and insulators (like rubber). They can conduct electricity under certain conditions, making them perfect for controlling electrical signals in devices.</p>
            <p>Common examples of semiconductor devices include diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits (ICs). Silicon, one of the most abundant elements on Earth, is the backbone of most semiconductor technologies.</p>

            <h2>How Do Semiconductors Work?</h2>
            <p>Semiconductors are made from crystals, usually silicon. These crystals are structured so that electrons can move through them in a controlled way. By adding impurities (a process called doping), manufacturers can change how electricity flows through the crystal, creating either N-type or P-type semiconductors.</p>
            <p>When these types are combined, they form junctions that can control the flow of electricity—this is how transistors and diodes work.</p>

            <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
            <p>Imagine your smartphone—its processor contains billions of semiconductor switches that allow it to perform tasks. Similarly, solar panels use semiconductors to convert sunlight into electricity. Even medical devices like pacemakers rely on semiconductors to function reliably.</p>
